Egusi Soup and Pounded yam
The most popular way to serve this soup is to pair with pounded yam. If you are desiring a delicious plate of egusi soups and pounded yam, prepare them separately.

Follow the recipe on this page to make the soup.

Pounded yam is just boiled yam that underwent the process of pounding ðŸ˜€

Recipes exist that have taken away the strenuous process of pounding. I learned you could make pounded yam with blenders or just buy yam flour and do it the easy way.

Here is the recipe for Pounded Yam

When you are done, you can serve both together.

Note: This soup can also be made with fluted pumpkin, they should follow the same process, the only difference is that bitter leaves should be replaced with fluted pumpkin leaves.

A combination of Ofe Egusi and Pounded Yam would be perfect for lunch
